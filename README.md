The Iron Yard Academy Week 1

My second day of learning at The Iron Yard Academy, I was given a PSD and told to write the appropriate HTML/CSS
to build a website that was a pixel-perfect replica of the PSD. Did I mention this was my second day?

'Mobber,' as it became affectionately known by us students, was an enormous challenge to us all. We had been
thrown to the front-end development wolves, and one of our fellow classmates was devoured, dropping out of the
class shortly thereafter.

For me, Mobber became an exercise in learning quickly, paying attention to detail and working extremely hard. I 
felt like every day of the first week would be my last, but I refused to give up. Though I missed the initial 
deadline for completion, my instructor was well-informed of my progress and allowed me to come back to the project
at a later date to put on the final touches.
